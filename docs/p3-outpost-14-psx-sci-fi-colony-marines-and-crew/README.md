**Product:** Outpost - 14 PSX Sci-Fi Colony Marines and Crew  
**Engine:** Low-poly PSX-era 3D model packs (Blender 5.2.3 headless under Tools/blender + MPFB/MakeHuman, CC0 output): rigged, animated character packs of 12-14 bodies x 3 palette skins (40+ entities), 300-1,575 tris each, ONE 256 px RGB555 texture per skin, the CC0 Quaternius humanoid skeleton with its 45 CC0 clips, GLB per skin + FBX + OBJ + .blend, the shipped PSX shader; bodies are built from code and PAINTED by OpenAI over their own orthographic renders (Kernel/capture/image_gen.js --ref, ~$0.16 per character), projected back and baked (Kernel/poly3d/build_pack.js). PROVEN by Kernel/poly3d/psx_gate.js (sha256, GLB containers, PNG sizes, tri budgets, distinct skins, look sheets, pack law, --break-test) + fresh_install.js (blank Godot 4 import); the agent then LOOKS at every sheet and a fresh subagent on Fable reviews (operator 2026-10-23). Themes: everything the itch top-sellers shelf shows transacting, never one genre. Creatures and props open at Roadmap M1. See Wings/Poly3D/CLAUDE.md.

# Outpost - 14 PSX Sci-Fi Colony Marines and Crew

Core Systems Asset Factory - low-poly PlayStation-era 3D character pack.

**14 characters x 3 palette skins = 42 entities · 45 animation clips + a reference T-pose on every character · one 256 x 256 px texture per skin · 1492-1498 triangles per character.**

Theme: science fiction frontier: the marines and colony crew of a remote outpost on a dusty red planet, for PlayStation era science fiction shooters and action games.

## What is in each character's folder (`models/<id>/`)

- `<id>_skin0.glb` - mesh + skeleton + ALL 46 clips + the skin 0 texture embedded (Godot, Unity, Unreal, three.js, Blender).
- `<id>_skin1.glb`, `<id>_skin2.glb` - the same mesh + skeleton with the other skins embedded (no clips: play the clips from `_skin0`, or swap the texture).
- `<id>.fbx` - mesh + skeleton + clips (textures referenced from `textures/`).
- `<id>.obj` + `<id>.mtl` - the static mesh in rest pose.
- `textures/<id>_skinN.png` - 256 px, 15-bit (RGB555) quantised, meant for NEAREST filtering.
- `blender_source/<id>.blend` (top level, outside `models/`) - the Blender 5.2 source (rig, clips, material). Keep it out of a Godot project folder: Godot tries to import every .blend it sees.

## Engines

- **Godot 4**: drop `models/` and `shaders/godot_psx.gdshader` into the project; instance the `_skin0.glb`; put a ShaderMaterial with `godot_psx.gdshader` on the mesh and set `albedo` to the skin texture (or keep the imported material and set its texture filter to Nearest). The AnimationPlayer carries every clip. Godot's importer drops the `_Loop` suffix and marks those clips as looping (`Walk_Loop` plays as `Walk`, `Idle_Loop` as `Idle`); every other name is unchanged.
- **Unity 6**: import the FBX, set Rig > Animation Type to Humanoid (the skeleton is a standard humanoid), textures to Point filtering; or import the GLB with a glTF importer.
- **Unreal 5**: import the FBX with its animations; retarget with an IK Rig if you use the UE mannequin skeleton; set the texture to Nearest.
- **Blender**: open the .blend (skin 0 is packed inside it); every clip is an action in the file.

What we ran before release: Godot 4.7.2 (a blank project imported every GLB, the PSX shader compiled and drew on every character, the clips played) and Blender 5.2 (every FBX, OBJ and .blend re-opened, meshes, 53 bones and every clip counted). Unity and Unreal were NOT run; their notes above are the standard humanoid FBX route.

## Skeleton and clips

The rig is the open (CC0) Quaternius Universal humanoid skeleton (53 bones, Rigify-style `DEF-` names), a standard humanoid layout made for retargeting (retargeting to another skeleton was not tested here; in Godot and Blender the clips were played on this skeleton). Clips (46: 45 animations + `A_TPose`, the reference T-pose): A_TPose, Crouch_Fwd_Loop, Crouch_Idle_Loop, Dance_Loop, Death01, Driving_Loop, Fixing_Kneeling, Hit_Chest, Hit_Head, Idle_Loop, Idle_Talking_Loop, Idle_Torch_Loop, Interact, Jog_Fwd_Loop, Jump_Land, Jump_Loop, Jump_Start, PickUp_Table, Pistol_Aim_Down, Pistol_Aim_Neutral, Pistol_Aim_Up, Pistol_Idle_Loop, Pistol_Reload, Pistol_Shoot, Punch_Cross, Punch_Enter, Punch_Jab, Push_Loop, Roll, Roll_RM, Sitting_Enter, Sitting_Exit, Sitting_Idle_Loop, Sitting_Talking_Loop, Spell_Simple_Enter, Spell_Simple_Exit, Spell_Simple_Idle_Loop, Spell_Simple_Shoot, Sprint_Loop, Swim_Fwd_Loop, Swim_Idle_Loop, Sword_Attack, Sword_Attack_RM, Sword_Idle, Walk_Formal_Loop, Walk_Loop.

## Scale and style

Characters stand about 1.8 m tall, Z-up in Blender / Y-up in glTF. The look is the mid-1990s console era: low triangle counts, hand-painted 256 px textures, no normal maps. Use nearest filtering and the PSX shader for the full effect (vertex snapping, affine texture warp, dithering, fog - every parameter is a slider).
